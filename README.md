# Basketball Tracking and Score Evaluation

### Synopsis

This is the repository of my semester project at [EPFL](www.epfl.ch). It contains the code
, the documentation and the final report.
The goal of this project was to create a score detecting system using the PlayfulVision tracking algorithm output
to determine if a basket has been scored.

This repository contains all the code and documentation of a semester project at [EPFL](www.epfl.ch). The goal was to achieve real-time people tracking and identification in sports. All the code and documentation is available under [this](LICENSE) license.

### Abstract

The goal of this semester project was to create a score detecting system to determine if a
basket has been scored. The system processes the data generated by the PlayfulVision ball
detection algorithm.
In this semester project we created a 3D model of the basketball court present in the
CSS. It was used to represent efficiently the data obtained with the PlayfulVision detection
algorithm in the form of a vertices graph. The results of the tracking algorithms can be
transformed into a video that can be displayed on the court. A score detection method
algorithm has been developped. Severals algorithm were tested to track the ball. Their
outputs were then used by the score detection algorithm to know if a score has occurred.
